# Process Killer

A simple app for testing application state saving and restoring.

**Important Android 14 Update**
Due to changes in the `ActivityManager.killBackgroundProcess` API, the app does not work on Android version 14.0 and above. See [ActivityManager docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager#killBackgroundProcesses(java.lang.String)) for more details.

## Setup

Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/livefront/process-killer-android.git

and build in Android Studio.

### Setup for release signing

If you need to create a signed APK for release to the Google Play Store, you will need to create a file called `upload-keystore.properties` at the root of the project containing the various properties needed to sign the app. The file will follow the format:

```
keyAlias = Enter-key-alias-here
keyPassword = Enter-key-password-here
storePassword = Enter-key-store-password-here
```

The final app signing is controlled through Google Play. The signing key stored in the repo is just the _upload key_, not the actual _release key_. If the alias or any passwords used above are lost, a new upload key can be created and used as long as it's updated on the Google Play Console.

## Description

The purpose of the app is to allow for testing how well apps restore their state after the system kills their host process. Applications with recent activity are displayed in a list; clicking on any of those items kills their host process (if they are currently running) in the same way the system would when reclaiming memory. The app can then be restarted from the link in the Snackbar or navigated to via a Launcher or Recents.

Note that running processes will only be killed if the system deems the action "safe". See the [documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/processes/process-lifecycle.html) for more details.
